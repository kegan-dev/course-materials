1. This code allows a programmer or user to scan ports at scanme.nmap.org.
2. The code has been modified for usability notes, to track closed ports, output to csv, and returns the total open and closed ports after a scan.
3. Additional modifications have been made to use a PortScanner struct so the programmer can define the behavior of a scanner. StartPort and EndPort
define the inclusive range of the ports for the scanner to check. Timeout defines the number of seconds until timing out when checking a port. Tests
have been added to check negative timeouts, and small or mismatched port ranges.
